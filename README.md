This page contains the source code of the webapp, a preprint with the algorithm and the results containing the algorithms,
the evaluation benchmark, including its initial version and its human labelled
version, statistics

**A. Preprint**
See the PDF including the algorithms and an experimental evaluation 

**B. Web App Code**
The folder "webAppCode" provides the  code of the web application.

**B. Evaluation Benhcmark**

We collected a list of famous Greek Persons and Places (i.e., since the current edition of the conference is in Greece). For the persons, we used the list of the 100 Greatest Greeks of all time (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Greeks), which contains persons from different eras (ancient and modern era) and disciplines (leaders, artists, etc.). For the places, we collected a list with famous heritage sites, the largest mountains and lakes, and popular cities and islands. The initial facts from ChatGPT and the manual labelling as Correct or Erroneous for each fact, can be found in the folder  "Evaluation Benhcmark".

**C. Experimental Results and Statistics**

The folder "Experimental Results and Evaluation" provides all the annotations, the experimental results and statistics. 

**D. Python Code**

The folder "pythonCode" provides the python code which was used and the corresponding jupyter notebook.
